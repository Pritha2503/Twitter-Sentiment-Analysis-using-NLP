# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLP
Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset is provided in the form of train.csv and test.csv, which contain tweet text and sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral). The goal is to classify the sentiment of each tweet using machine learning algorithms and NLP methods.

The project uses Python and several libraries, such as pandas for data handling, nltk for text processing, and scikit-learn for building the sentiment classifier.

Features

Load CSV Files: Read training and testing datasets containing tweet text and sentiment labels.

Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the tweet text by removing stop words, punctuation, URLs, mentions, etc.

Sentiment Classification: Build a machine learning model to classify tweet sentiments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Visualization: Visualize the distribution of sentiments and the performance of the model.
